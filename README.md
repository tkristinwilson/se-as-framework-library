# SE-AS framework modelling library

This repository contains a modelling library `SE-AS 0.1` which can be used in draw.io (free, high quality diagramming software, online or desktop) to create conceptual models of social-ecological systems using the social-ecological action situation (SE-AS) framework.<sup>[1](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss3/art11/)</sup>

A list of case studies from the literature is included as examples of different system interests, supplied either as CC BY 4.0 or CC BY-NC 4.0. Each case study is annotated with its full reference.

## Prerequisites
- draw.io [online](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [desktop](https://www.drawio.com).

## Usage

- Existing/New Diagram - from an existing diagram in draw.io select `File > Open Library` and open `SE-AS 0.1.xml` (download from the `lib` folder or open from GitHub using the online version).

- Starter Diagram - or, download a copy the starter drawing in `docs/starter.drawio`.

- For guidance applying the analytical framework, refer to the two main references below and the individual case studies.
